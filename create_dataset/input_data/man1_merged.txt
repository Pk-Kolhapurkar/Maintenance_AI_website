## 1 INTRODUCTION

This manual describes the machlne(s) specified In the title of this manual.

## 1-1 Outline of the Machine

## 1-1-1 Intended use of the machine

The  HCN-6800 Is a horizontal machining center that represents Yamazaki Mazak's medium-scale machining centers and provides high economic efficiency and high productivity.

They can minimize machining lead lime by achieving ultra-high-speed operation, and minimize cutting time by utilizing the latest tools and high-speed machining technologies, in machining of a wide variety of  workpieces In small to medium-sized quantities.

## 1-1-2 Operating positions

## -1-3 Features

## 1. High productivity

Reduced machining lead time brings improved productivity. Operation of the machine is high speed: the rapid  traverse rate is  60 m/min  (2362 1PM),  the automaHc tool change  time  is 4_ 2 ~eco~ds (chip-to-chip), the automatic pallet change time is  10 seconds,  and the table indexing time Is  1.9 s/90°. These high-speed features are effective for production that requires frequent tool  changes  and  pallet  indexing,  or  frequent  pallet  changes  with  short  machining  times achieving a drastic reduction of the machining lead time. '

The high-speed and high-power spindle with a maximum speed of 10000 min1 , the motor output of 37/30 kW {30 min.leant.), and the maximum torque of 586 N·m (432.2 ft·lbf) allow heavy-duty operation  in  rough  machining  of steel,  cast,  and  aluminum  workpieces,  and  high-speed  and high-accuracy operation in finish machining.

In addition, the following optional specifications are available:

8000 min1 specifications offering high-torque, high-speed, and heavy-duty cutting spindles with a maximum speed of 8000 rnin1 , motor output of  37/30 kW (30 min./cont.), and maximum torque of 1218 N·m (898.4 ft·lbf) that are effective for heavy-duty cutting of  steel

6000 min1 specifications offering high-torque and heavy-duty cutting spindles with a maximum speed  of 6000  min-1,  motor  output  of 37/30 kW (30  min./cont.),  and  maximum  torque  of 1413 N ·  m (  1042.2 ft·  I  bf) that are effective as hard metal specifications

16000 min1 specifications offering high-speed spindles with a maximum speed of 16000 min1 , motor output of  37/30 kW (30 min./coot.), and maximum torque of 315 N·m (232.3 ft·lbf) that are effective for machining of  workpieces made of relatively soft metal

Through-spindle coolant enables accurate hole machining at high speed. In tapping operations, synchronized tapping is possible even in the high spindle speed range.

Adoption of low-inertia servomotors and  high-speed ball screws has achieved a rapid traverse rate of 60 m/min (2362 1PM) and an accelera&amp;ioll of 7.84 m/s 2 (25.72 ft/s 2 ) . Positioning time can be reduced even in posi&amp; ioning over a short distance.

The newly developed CNC performs ultra-high-speed calculations and motions simultaneously, drastically reducing idle times for higher productivity.

## 2. Machine construction that guarantees high-accuracy

FEM analysis (structural analysis by the finite element method using a computer) was adopted in the design  of this  model.  The columo  traverse construction  successfully suppresses vibration during operation involving high acceleration/deceleration and maintains consistent high accuracy over the long term.

The use of  taper cone couplings at the joint between the pallet and the table provides high rigidity and improved repeatability at pallet changes.

Linear guides are used  for the guideways,  providing  high  rig(dity  to  ensure  high  acc~racy  in high-speed  operation. Bi-directional  positioning  accuracy  Is  0.015  mm  (0.0006  in)  and bi-directional repeatability 0.010 mm (0.0004 in).

## 2-5

## Safety Considerations Relating to Machine Operation

- The use of inflammable lubricant as coolant is not recommended as it is dangerous and may cause a fire. If such use is unavoidable, it is the responsibility of management to ensure a  fire  extinguisher is  readily available  as a  safety  measure. Additionally,  if an inflammable lubricant is used, the machine should  never perform  unmanned operation. An operator must always be present to ensure safety. The same precautions must be taken when machining iinflammable materials such as magnesium alloy.
- Close all doors and covers of the NC unit, operating panel, electrical control cabinet, and junction boxes to prevent damage from water, chips, and oil.
- Check all  electrical  cables for damage to  prevent accidents due to  current  leakage or electric shock.
- Do no4: handle coolant with bare hands since it is liable to cause irritation. Operators with allergies should take special precautions.
- Do not operate the machine duri5ig violent thunderstorms.
- Check the safety covers regularly to make sure that they are properly fitted and that they are not damaged. Repair or replace any damaged covers immediately.
- Always obtain assistance in handling loads beyond your capacity.
- If  the  machine  door,  the  cover,  or  other  glass  sections  are  found  to  be  damaged, immediately stop the machine and replace the damaged sections. Failure to observe this instruction may result in injury due to the possible flyaway of  the chuck jaws or tool during machining. When ordering replacement parts from the nearest Mazak Technical Center or Technology Center, refer to the Parts List and specify the part numbers.
- Do riot operate fork lifts or cranes or carry out s~nging work unless you have undergone officially approved training.
- When using fork lifts or cranes, make sure that there are no obstructions in the vicinity of these machines.
- Always use wire rope or slings of a standard suitable for the load to be supported.
- Wait until the machine has come to a complete stop before adjusting the position of the coolant nozzle.

CAUTION

WARNING

CAUTION

- Do_ not remove or otherwise interfere with safety devices such as stop dogs, limit switches, or interlocks in order to increase axis travel.
- Do not operate the machine with any of the safety covers removed.
- •
- Always wear gloves and use a brush to clean chips off the tool tip; never use bare hands.
- •
- Stop all machine operations before mounting or removing a tool.
- Check slings,  chains,  hoists,  and  other lifting  gear for  defects  before  use. Repair or replace defective gear immediately.
- Electromagnetic waves  are  radiated  from  the  NC  machine tool. Although  the  level  of radiation  is quite low compared  to  that from  a cell  phone terminal,  reliable  operation  of medical  electrical  devices  cannot  be  guaranteed,  so  be  sure  to  determine  in  advance whether or not you  can  engage  in  operations at the  operating  panel  by  consulting  the manufacturer of your medical electrical device and your physician.

~

- Write the program for the warming-up operation so as to execute the functions of the full range  of machine  compooents. If operation  is  to  be  performed  at spindle  speeds  in excess of  4000 min1 , pay meticulous attention to the warming-up operation.
- Do  not allow chips  to  accumulate during  heavy-duty cutting  since  they will  be  hot and could start a fire.
- Warm up the spindle and all of the axis motion mechanisms before operation. (Operate the machine in the automatic mode for 10 to 20 minutes at maximum spindle speed or at 1/3 to 1/2 maximum axis motion speed.)
- Do not operate the operating  panel  switches whW e wearing  gloves as this could  lead to incorrect operation or other mistakes.
- After the  completion  of one series of operations, switch off the power supply to the NC unit,  the  main  power disconnect switch  of the  machine, then  the factory  power supply before leaving the machine.

## 2-6 Safety Considerations Relating to Holding Workpieces and Tooling

- Always use tools which  are suitable for the work to  be  carried  out and  conform  to  the machine specifications. Always observe the restrictions on  mass of tool insert and tool diameter stipulated in the specifications. [Max. insert mass: 20 g (0.04 lbs)]
- Before  starting  operation,  check  that  the  workpiece  is  securely  mounted  and  cannot become detached by the cutting forces applied to it during machining.
- Replace tools promptly, since badly worn tools can cause accidents and injuries.
- Before mounting a cutting tool in the machine, make sure that the tool and its stud bolt are properly secured.
- Do not rotate a cutting tool or holder at speeds higher than the rated speed.
- Check maximum safe operating speeds with the manufacturer.
- Be very careful not to catch your fingers in workpiece holding devices.

- Make sure you fully understand how to maintain the machine.
- Do not use compressed air to cleoo the machine or to remove chips.
- Always use gloves when clearing away chips; never touch chips with bare hands.
- Use  only  the  specified  grades  of  hydraulic  oil, lubricating  oil,  and  grease  or  their equivalents.
- When changing a fuse, check that the new fuse has the correct rating. (Using a fuse with too high a rating could result in damage to the equipment.)
- Follow the instructions on  the instruction  plate concerning the  brands of oil  to  be  used, lubrication points, amount to be used, and oil change intervals.
- Check the results of maintenance work in the presence of the person in charge.
- Stop all machine operation before cleaning the machine or the surrounding area.
- Substances that have adverse effects on the environment if not disposed of appropriately are used in some of the equipment used in Mazak machine tools. In order to protect the environment, dispose of machine tools and accessory equipment in accordance with the laws of the country concerned. Entrust the  processing  to  a contractor who deals with industrial waste. Note that any expenses associated with this processing are to be borne by the customer.

## 2-8 Safety Considerations Relating to Workplace

- Immediately remove all  water and  oil spills from  the floor,  and  dry the floor to prevent accidents.
- Use strong service platforms only an~ make sure that nothing can slip off them.
- Keep combustible  materials well  away from  the work area  and  any other place  where there are hot chips.
- Always provide sufficient lighting in the work area.
- Always provide sufficient working space and clear access to the machine and peripheral equipment and store tools and other potential obstacles in a prescribed place away from the machine.
- Never place tools or other potentially dangerous objects on top of  the headstock, turret, or covers.
- Make sure that the nom.nal cross-sectional area of the power supply cable between the factory power supply switch and the machine main power disconnect switch is such as to enable a stable supply for operation at the maximum output.

## 3 OUTLINE OF THE MACHINE STRUCTURE

## 3-1 Overview of Machine Units

The machine consists of the following major units (see Fig. 3-1.).

## 1. Spindle

The spindle is driven by an AC inverter motor.

A  cutting tool  is  clamped  in  the spindle by spring force  and  a  hydraulic cylinder is  used  to  force out the cutting tool from  the  spindle.

Cooling  fluid  is  circulated  around  the  spindle  outer  casing  to  minimize  temperature  rise  of  the spindle due to generation of heat from  the bearings.

## 2. X-axis

The column travels longitudinally, driven by an AC servomotor and a  ball  screw.

A  position encoder used for  position detection is  built in  the servomotor.

Linear guides are used as the guide for the column to  move on  the  base.

## 3 Y-axis

The spindlehead travels vertically, driven  by  an  AC  servomotor anda ball screw.

A position encoder used for position detection is built in the servomotor. A

Linear guides are used as the guide for the spindlehead to move along the column.

## 4. Z-axis

The table travels in  the crosswise direction, driven  by an  AC  servomotor anda  ball  screw.

A position encoder used for  position  detection is  built in  the servomotor.

Linear guides are used  as the guide for the table to move on  the  base.

## 5. ATC

The  roler-cam type  ATC  mounts/removes a tool  to/from  the spindle.

## 6. Tool shifter (not available with  43/60-tool magazine  specifications)

The tool shifter carries  a tool between the  magazine and  the ATC  unit. The tool shifter consists of the  ATC standby  pocket and  the  magazine  shifter. The ATC standby pocket turns a tool  90 degrees  to  change  the  phase  of  the  key  groove  in  a  tool. The  magazine  shifter  is  of  the roller-cam type  unit and carries a tool  between the  magazine and the ATC  standby pocket.

## 7. Magazine

The  magazine stores tools. The magazine is driven  by an AC  servomotor to  index the specified tool to  the  tool change position.

## 8. Tabie

An  AC  servomotor  rotates  (indexes)  the  pallet,  and  a hydraulic  cykinder  clamps/unclamps  the pallet.

## 9. Pallet changer

By the  rotation of  the arm,  a pallet on  the  table  is  changed with  a pallet at the  setup station the  rotation  of  the  arm,  an AC  servomotor  is  used. At  the  setup  station, a  pallet can  be turned manually to facilitate  set up.

## 10. Hydraulic unit

A  hydraulic  pump  generates  hydraulic  pressure  by  pumplng  worklng  ol  reserved  in  the  tank  i. operate hydraulic actuators.

Refer to  5-7-3  "Hydraulic circuit  diagram".

## 11. Air  unit

An  external air source is  connected to the  air unit to  supply the  pressure-regulated air to  operate pneumatic actuators.

Refer to  5-8-3  "Pneumatic circuit diagram".

The air  unit  consists  of a filter  (with  automatic  drain  system),  regulator  (reducing  valve),  shut-off valve,  etc.

## 12. Centralized  Iubrication  unit

For spindle:

The unit suppies lubricating  oil  to  the  spindle  bearings and  chain  magazine.

By  the intermittent  operation (in intervals  of  4  minutes)  of  the  pump, lubricating oil is supplied to the  each lubricating  point automatically.

For slideway:

Supply grease to the ball  screws and the linear guides.

## 13. Spindle cooling unit

A trochoid  pump  is  used  to  draw  cooling  fluid  from  the  tank  and  feeds  it  to  the oil chiller  where cooling  fluid  is  cooled. Then,  the  cooling  fluid  is  fed  to  the  outer case of the  spindle. Cooling fluid  absorbs  heat from  the  spindle  and  is  cooled  by  the  radiator and  the  fan;  cooled  oil  is  then circulated to the tank.

Refer to  5-10-4 "Spindle cooling  circuit diagram".

## 14. Coolant system

A  coolant pump is used to feed coolant, pumped from the coolant tank, to coolant nozzles.

Refer to 5-11-3 "Coolant circuit diagram".

## &lt; Procedure &gt;

- (1)  If  alarm  209  SLIDEWAY  OIL  MALFUNCTION  occurred  due  to  emptied  tank,  perform  the steps below.

Note  that  alarm  209  cannot  be  released  until  grease  is  replenished. (f this  alarm  occurs during automatic operation,  the machine stops operating in  the single  block state.)

- (2) Check the grease cartridge if it holds grease.
2. If  it  is empty,  replace  the grease cartridge  and  perform steps (3) and  on.

Fig.  4-10 Replacing  the grease cartridge

If  it  holds  grease,  the  grease lubrication circuit  may  contain the air. In  this  case,  bleed  the air  from  the  circuit  according  to  the  procedure  explained  in  item  3.  "Bleeding  air and  then perform steps (3) and  on.

- (3) Select the manual mode.
- (4) Tap the

button  at the top right of the  NC screen and then tap

- ' The following  menu  is  displayed.

## (5) Tap [OPTION1].

- ' The following  menu  is  displayed.

## (6) Tap [GREASE PUMP ON..

The menu  display on the screen blinks and grease starts to  be supplied. On completion  o grease supply, the menu display changes to blue and then returns to the initial state.

- (7) Make sure that alarm 209 SLIDEWAY OIL MALFUNCTION is released.

If the alarm still remains active,  it  indicates the  possibility that the grease lubrication circui contains the air.

## A. Prohibitions about the use of grease

- Failure  to  observe  these  prohibitions  might  result  in  a  machine  trouble,  coagulation  o performance  degradation. (The  term  "coagulation"  refers  to  a  phenomenon  in  which grease becomes hard.)
- Do  not use any brand of grease other than those recommended  by the manufacturer. Fo the recommended brands of grease, see Section 7-1-1  "List of oiling points".
- Never use grease containing molybdenum disuifide.
- Avoid  using  grease that has been stored for an  extended  period  of time  if oil  has separated from  other ingredients. Grease with a small  amount of oil  on the surface,  however,  may be used.

## B. Cautions about the storage of grease

- Keep the lid closed securely.
- Store grease indoors,  in  a cool  place where it will  not  be exposed to  direct sunlight,  rain  or dust.
- Since the grease container has no  label to show product name and  code,  pay due attention not to confuse the grease container with other containers.
- Always store a spare grease cartridge.
- Replace the grease cartridge when it is emptied.
- Do  not re-use the grease cartridge by replenishing grease. Replenishing grease can cause entry of foreign matter and air into the grease in  the cartridge that will cause machine trouble.

## 3 Bleeding air

Always  bleed the  air when connecting a product or if the air is trapped  in  the pump.

Loosen  the  air  bleed  plug  in  the  pump  (turn  the  valve  counterclockwise by  1 turn)  and  keep  the pump  operating until air  does  not  come  out  any  more  but  only  grease  is  discharged. After completing air bleeding work, tighten the air bleed  plug.

## 5-8-2 Maintenance of the air unit

## 1. Changing the filter element of mist separator

- Shut  off the  power  to  the  machine  by  turning  the  main  power  disconnect  to  the  "OFF" position and  disconnect  the  external  air  source  before  changing the filter element. Attempting  to  change  the  filter  element  without  taking  these  precautions  could  cause machine damage or severe injuries.

The filter element is a consumable part and  should  be changed every two years.

In  the list  given  in  7-2  "List  of Wearable Parts",  "element ass'y" indicates  a set of filter  element,  O ring, and  gasket. When changing the filter  element, order the "element ass'y".

The  compound oil control unit  means  the  unit  where  the  oil  cooling  unit  (chiller  unit)  and  the hydraulic unit are integrated into one unit.

- Cooling fluid  in  the tank is drawn  by the  pump  in  the  compound oil control  unit.
- Cooling fluid  is  cooled  by the chiller unit and fed  to  the spindle and  the ball  screw.
- Cooling fluid  absorbs heat generated at the  spindle and the ball screw to  be  warmed.
- The warmed cooling fluid  is  cooled by the chiller unit.

## 5-10-3 Processing of refrigerant

HFCs  (hydrochlorofluorocarbons: alternatives to  chlorofluorocarbons) are used as  refrigerants in compound oil  control  units. HFCs must be  collected  and  disposed  of  in  accordance with  the applicable  national  regulations. Therefore,  when  disposing  of  a  compound  oil  control unit. contact a waste  collection and  disposal  service  company and  ask  for  appropriate  processing of the HFCs. Note : If  you  have  no  contact  with  an  appropriate  waste  collection  and  disposal  service company,  please  contact the  nearest  Mazak  Technical Center or  Technology  Center. We will  respond to  your  request.

## 6 INSTALLATION

## 6-1 Precautions on Installing the Machine

&amp;

- Before starting the installation work, read Chapter 2 "SAFETY PRECAUTIONS" and make sure you thoroughly understand the information in this Chapter.

WARNING

- The floor  must be  completely  dry  and  free  of oil  so  that  operators  will  not  slip  and  fall during  carrying  and  installation  of the  machine,  electrical work, machine adjustments, or other work.
- Safety equipment (helmet, safety shoes, etc.) and clothing appropriate for the work to be undertaken must be worn.
- Use wire rope or slings whose specifications state that they can support the weight to be lifted, and inspect them for any abnormality before use.
- Lifting  aids such as wire rope  and  slings must be  secured at the specified  locations, and the lifting angle must be correct.
- During  piping  and  wiring  work,  check  the  matchmarks  between  the  hose  and  fitting location when fitting hoses.
- Prepare an air source that meets the external air source requirements.
- Prepare a power source that meets the external power source requirements.
- When connecting the main power disconnect switch to the power source, carry out piping work such that the main power disconnect switch box is protected to IP54 standards.
- When  carrying  out  machine  adjustments,  refer  to  the  safety  considerations  relating  to safety devices and make sure that all safety devices function correctly.

## 6-2 Preparing for Installation

## 6-2-1 Environmental requirements

## 1. Machine

Avoid the following places for installing the machine.

- Places where the machine is exposed to direct sunlight, near a heat source, or temperature varies excessively.
- Places near the exit where external air will flow in.
- Take  into  consideration  environment  so  that  machine  generating  heat  will  be  easily dissipated.
- Do not apply wind blown from the air conditioner directly to the machine.
- Places where the floor is not strong enough to support the machine.
- Places near vibration generation equipment.
- Humid and dusty places.

Note 1: If  the machine  has  to be installed near vibration-generating equipment,  make foundation  according  to  the  specification  of  Mazak  and  take  appropriate  measures against vibration.

- Note 2: If the  soil  is  weak, reinforce  it  by  driving  piles to  avoid  settling  and  subsidence of the soil after the installation of a machine.

## 2. NC

## A. Ambient temperature

Allowable temperature range during machine operation: +5 to +40°C (+41  to +104°F)

## B. Relative humidity

Allowable relative humidity during operation: 30 to 75% (no condensation)

- As humidity increases, it impairs  insulation  and  also  accelerates deterioration  of electric component parts. Although  it is  not necessary to  take special dehumidifying measures, installation of a machine in humid places should be avoided.

~

## C. Atmosphere

Although  installation  of the  machine should  be avoided  in  a dusty area  or area where there is high  concentration  of organic  or corrosive  gas,  if the  machine  must  be  operated  under such environment, consult Mazak for appropriate measures.

## D. Vibration

Allowable maximum vibration during operation:

4.9 m/s 2 (16.08 fVs 2 ) or lower

Allowable maximum vibration during transportation:

34.3 m/s 2 (112.53 fVs 2 )  or lower

## 3. Requirements for maintaining the guaranteed accuracy

- A. Basic requirements

The machine should  be  installed  at a  site  with  tightly-packed  soil  no  vibration-generating equipment nearby.

- B. Environmental requirements (air conditioned)

Ambient temperature:

20 - 2°C (68 - 3.6°F)

Temperature variation:

1  °c  (1 .8°F)/30 min or lower

Relative humidity:

75% or lower

Dust and other foreign matter:

0.3 mg/m 3 or lower

-2-2

## External power source requirements

- To  connect  the  power  supply  cable  to  the  machine,  grounding  of  class  C  or  higher (grounding resistance is 10 nor lower) is required .

WARNING

- If the specified class of grounding work is impossible due to restrictions such as machine installation place environment, class D grounding (grounding resistance is 100 nor lower) can be applied by mounting a leak breaker (option) to the main power disconnect.
- Use cable conductors that meet the following requirements (200 VAC power source)
- Primary power cable: 80  mm 2 (0.12  in 2 ) or  larger  ([MLFC  equivalent] Max. allowable temperature of insulator: 110°c  (230°F))

Grounding cable:

40 mm 2 (0.06 in 2 ) or larger

For  details  of  the  power  source  connection  cable  specifications  corresponding  to  the available source voltage, refer to Table 6-2.

There are four groups of source voltage as below and the usable source voltage depends on the machine specification. Make sure to check the specified input voltage.

- (1) 200/220 VAC (JPN), (2) 200 - 240 VAC/460 - 480 VAC (USA),
- (3) 380 - 415 VAC (other countries), (4) 380/400/415 VAC (EU)
- When an earth leakage breaker is used,  use the one for AC  inverters. (Recommended breaker: current rating of 200 mA)
- If the breaker for AC inverters is not used, the breaker can trip to shut off the power due to high-frequency leak current specific to AC inverter. (An earth leakage breaker with a 30 mA trip current rating  must not be used since it could malfunction.)

## 1. Power source voltage

- When  installing  the  machine,  the  machine  may  malfunction  if  the  power  capacity  is insufficient and the service life of the electric parts will be shortened.
- In some cases, this may incur serious problems from the standpoint of safety. Therefore, always pay sufficient attention to the power facility so that sufficient power can be supplied to the machine.
- If the  capacity  of  power  source  is  insufficient,  axis  control  will  get  unstable  to  cause collision.

Allowable input voltage of the machines is determined from the following four groups according to the machine specifications. Make sure to  check the  allowable input voltage of your machine before connecting it to the power source.

## 6-2-4 Items to be confirmed when carrying the machine

## 1. Machine dimensions

In  order  to  carry  the  machine  into  the  plant,  an  entrance  that  will  allow  the  machine  to  pass through must be available (dimensions indicated in the following illustration).

## Foundation work

- If the machine has to be installed  near vibration-generating equipment, it is necessary to take  appropriate  measures  such as providing a  vibration insulation  pit  around  the machine.
- If the soil  is weak,  reinforce  it by  driving  piles to  avoid  settling  and  subsidence of the soil after the installation of a machine.

For machine installation, select a flat place; avoid places subject to direct sunlight, humid places, and  places  near vibration  generation  equipment. Although  required  foundation  work  will  vary according to soil conditions, it is necessary to compact the ground well or pour concrete to avoid settlement or inclination of the soil after machine installation.
